Insurance Purchase Prediction Using Logistic Regression

This repository contains a Python script that applies logistic regression to predict whether a person will buy insurance based on their age. The model is trained using historical insurance data and demonstrates key machine learning concepts like data splitting, model training, and prediction.

Key Features:

- Data Handling:Utilizes the `pandas` library to read and preprocess the dataset (`insurance_data.csv`).
- Model Building:Implements logistic regression using the `scikit-learn` library to predict the likelihood of buying insurance.
- Accuracy Evaluation: Evaluates model performance by calculating accuracy on the test data.
- Prediction Function:Provides a user-input-driven prediction function that utilizes the logistic regression coefficients to determine the likelihood of a new customer buying insurance.

Usage:

1. Data Preparation: Ensure the `insurance_data.csv` file is present in your working directory.
2. Run the Script:Execute the script to train the model and test its accuracy.
3. Make Predictions:Use the built-in function to predict insurance purchase behavior based on age input.
